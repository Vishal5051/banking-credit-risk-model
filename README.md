- **credit_customers (DS).csv**: Dataset used for model training.
- **SVM_LINEAR_BEST_MODEL.pkl**: Pre-trained model file.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.

## How to Use the Application

### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have all required Python packages installed. You can install them using:

```bash
